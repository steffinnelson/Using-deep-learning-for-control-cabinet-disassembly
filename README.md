GitHub Repository Description

Automated Image-Based Disassembly of Control Cabinets Using Deep Learning
This repository contains the implementation and experimental workflows developed during my project thesis at FAPS, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU).
The work focuses on building a deep learning–based vision framework for automated disassembly of control cabinet components using state-of-the-art object detection models.

Scope of My Work

Collected and annotated real-world and prototype control cabinet datasets (14 component classes).

Trained YOLOv11, Co-DETR, and Co-DINO models on a unified dataset.

Implemented dataset reduction and active learning pipelines for efficient labeling and retraining.

Developed an ensemble learning strategy combining YOLO, Co-DETR, and Co-DINO predictions using Weighted Boxes Fusion.

Designed a specialized YOLOv11 model for terminal block detection.

Performed quantitative and qualitative analysis (IoU, mAP50–95, Jaccard Index, Wilcoxon tests, Grad-CAM).

Access Policy

Due to university confidentiality and data protection policy, the code and dataset are not made public.
However, access can be granted privately upon reasonable academic request.
